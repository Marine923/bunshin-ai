# Changelog

All notable changes to Bunshin are documented in this file. The format is
roughly [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-15

This release transforms Bunshin from a working prototype into a polished
desktop product. Highlights:

### Added — desktop & distribution
- **Native Mac app** (Electron 33). Splash, native menus following OS
  language, single-instance lock, persisted window geometry, dock icon,
  ⌘+K / ⌘+N / ⌘+R shortcuts.
- **Auto-update infrastructure** for users who install the DMG.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** building and uploading DMGs on tag push.
- **Linux scheduler support** — `bunshin install-scheduler` auto-detects
  macOS (launchd) / Linux+systemd (`systemctl --user`) / Linux+cron.

### Added — search & retrieval
- **Hybrid search** combining sqlite-vec semantic similarity with FTS5
  BM25 keyword scoring via reciprocal rank fusion (default mode).
- **Result deduplication** by source — at most one chunk per source_id by
  default, with `total_in_source` hint for "📚 N more in this conversation".
- **Source filter chips** — Claude / Gmail / files / memos / calendar /
  LINE / browser. Combinable with period filter.
- **Upgraded embedding model** to `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` (1024d,
  ~2 GB) for materially better Japanese recall. `bunshin migrate-embeddings`
  command handles the transition.

### Added — chat
- **Multi-turn conversations** with persistent sessions in `chat_sessions`
  + `chat_messages` tables, sidebar UI with delete/resume, automatic title
  generation from the first user message.
- **Citation links** — assistant responses include `[1] [2]` markers that
  scroll to the corresponding context block.
- **Improved system prompt** that pushes the LLM to actively cite,
  surface dates, and avoid lazy "I have no information" replies.

### Added — ingestion
- **PDF and DOCX** files via pypdf / python-docx.
- **Browser history** for Safari / Chrome / Arc (reads via temp DB copy
  so it works while the browser is running). Incremental via watermark.
- **Audio transcription** (`bunshin transcribe`) with three backends
  (`faster-whisper`, `openai-whisper`, `whisper-cpp`).
- **Real-time file watching** via watchdog — file edits show up in search
  within seconds, no waiting for the hourly job.
- **Manual memos** via `bunshin note` or the chat input prefix
  `覚えといて:` / `メモ:`.

### Added — graph & insights
- **LLM-based entity discovery** — `bunshin graph discover` samples records
  and asks the local LLM to extract people / organizations / projects.
  Brought our local graph from 37 → 137 meaningful entities. Noise filter
  rejects single-letter tags and AI-tool names.
- **Specificity-scored entity relations** (specificity = co-occurrence
  divided by the related entity's total mentions).
- **AI-generated 7-day digest** in the Insights tab — Ollama produces a
  three-section Japanese summary of recent activity.

### Added — settings & ops
- **Settings UI** at the Web `⚙ 設定` tab, backed by a typed KV store
  (`settings.py`) for notifications, search defaults, chat defaults.
- **Automatic daily backups** (`VACUUM INTO` snapshots in
  `~/.bunshin/backups/`, retention default 7).
- **`bunshin doctor`** diagnoses DB / Ollama / Gmail / Calendar / MCP /
  scheduler and prints actionable remediation hints.
- **Cross-platform scheduler module** with launchd / systemd / cron paths.

### Fixed
- Menu language detection that defaulted to English on first launch
  (now refreshed inside `app.whenReady`).
- Knowledge graph SQL bug where the CTE referenced `v.distance` instead
  of the unprefixed alias post-join.
- Vector dimensions mismatch detection so `migrate-embeddings` reliably
  recognizes which model is currently active.

### Known limitations
- **macOS code signing** is not configured — first launch requires
  right-click → Open or running `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`.
- **Knowledge-graph relations** still include some lexical noise
  (use `bunshin graph cleanup`).
- **Whisper** requires a manual `pip install` of one of the three
  backends; we don't ship one by default.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-09

Initial release — Phase 0/1 prototype of the 4-condition personal
memory AI: local-first SQLite + sqlite-vec storage, AI-agnostic via
MCP, offline-capable via Ollama, omni-source ingestion of Claude
history / Gmail / files / calendar / LINE / manual memos.

See README for the design intent and the four conditions.
